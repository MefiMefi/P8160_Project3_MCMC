# Introduction

# Dataset
hurrican703.csv collected the track data of 702 hurricanes in  the North Atlantic area from 1950 to 2013. For all the storms, their location (longitude \& latitude) and maximum wind speed were recorded every 6 hours. The data includes the following variables 

1. **ID**:  ID of the hurricans

2. **Season**: In which \textbf{year} the hurricane occurred

3. **Month**: In which \textbf{month} the hurricane occurred 

4. **Nature**:  Nature of the hurricane 
  + ET: Extra Tropical
  + DS: Disturbance
  + NR: Not Rated
  + SS: Sub Tropical
  + TS: Tropical Storm
5. **time**: dates and time of the record  

6. **Latitude** and **Longitude**:  The location of  a hurricane check point 

7. **Wind.kt**  Maximum wind speed (in Knot) at each check point 

From the original dataset, we built a new dataset with contains five more variables, including:

1. **Wind_prev**: wind speed at 6 hours ago

2. **Wind_prev_prev**: wind speed at 12 hours ago

3. **Lat_change**: latitude change compared to 6 hours earlier

4. **Long_change**: longitude change compared to 6 hours earlier

5. **Wind_change**: wind speed change at 6 hours earlier compared to 12 hours earlier

These variables will help us to build the model in the following part.

The $hurricanoutcome2.csv$ recorded the damages and death caused by 46 hurricanes in the U.S, and some features extracted from the hurricane records. The variables include:

1. **ID**: ID of the hurricans
    
2. **Season**: In which \textbf{year} the hurricane occurred 
    
3. **Month**: In which \textbf{month} the hurricane occurred 
    
4. **Nature**: Nature of the hurricane 
    + ET: Extra Tropical
    + DS: Disturbance
    + NR: Not Rated
    + SS: Sub Tropical
    + TS: Tropical Storm
      
5. **Damage**: Financial loss (in Billion U.S. dollars) caused by hurricanes
    
6. **Deaths**: Number of death caused by hurricanes
    
7. **Maxspeed**: Maximum recorded wind speed of the hurricane
    
8. **Meanspeed**: average  wind speed of the hurricane
    
9. **Maxpressure**: Maximum recorded central pressure of the hurricane
    
10. **Meanpressure**: average central pressure of the hurricane
    
11. **Hours**: Duration of the hurricane in hours 
    
12. **Total.Pop**: Total affected population   
    
13. **Percent.Poor**: % affected population that reside in low GDP countres (i.e. GDP per Capita $<=$ 10,000)

## EDA

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
dt= read.csv("./hurrican703.csv")
library(data.table)
dt <- as.data.table(dt)
summary(dt)

library(tidyverse)
dt_long <- dt %>%
    dplyr::group_by(ID) %>% 
    mutate(Wind_prev = lag(Wind.kt, 1),
           Lat_change = Latitude - lag(Latitude, 1),
           Long_change = Longitude - lag(Longitude, 1),
           Wind_prev_prev = lag(Wind.kt, 2)) %>% 
    mutate(Wind_change = Wind_prev - Wind_prev_prev)
```

We use a bar plot to examine the number of hurricanes in each month. From Figure 1, we can see that September is the month with the most hurricanes, while there are no hurricanes in February and March. Hurricanes in September also have the highest average wind speed as we can see in Figure 2. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig1, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
storms_month_name = distinct(group_by(select(dt_long, Month, ID), Month))

storms_month_name %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Month) %>% 
  mutate(Month =  factor(Month, levels = month.name)) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = Month)) +
  geom_bar()
```
\begin{center}

\end{center}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig2, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
dt_long %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Month) %>% 
  mutate(avg_speed = mean(Wind.kt)) %>% 
  distinct(Month, avg_speed) %>% 
  mutate(Month =  factor(Month, levels = month.name))%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = avg_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous("Average Speed (knot)")
```

\end{center}
If we group the hurricanes by years, we can see in general, we have more observations in recently years compared to 50 years ago as shown in Figure 3. However, from Figure 4, the average wind speed seems to have a decreasing trend.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig3, fig.height=3.8, fig.width=7}
storms_season_name = distinct(group_by(select(dt_long, Season, ID), Season))
ggplot(data = storms_season_name) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Season)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year")
```
\begin{center}

\end{center}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig4, fig.height=3.8, fig.width=7}

  dplyr::group_by(Season) %>% 
  mutate(avg_speed = mean(Wind.kt)) %>% 
  distinct(Season, avg_speed) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Season, y = avg_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  scale_y_continuous("Average Speed (knot)") +
  scale_x_continuous("Year") 
```
\begin{center}

\end{center}
We also compare the hurricanes with different natures. In our dataset, there are 1214 different nature ratings. This number is larger than the number of hurricanes because some hurricanes are in different natures at different time. From Figure 5, we know that more than half of the natures are in Tropical Storm category. This nature also have the highest average wind speed at about 60 knot, while the disturbance and not rated hurricanes have average wind speed at round 20 knot as Figure 6 illustrates.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig5, fig.height=3.8, fig.width=7}
storms_nature_name = distinct(group_by(select(dt_long, Nature, ID), Nature))
ggplot(data = storms_nature_name) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Nature))
```

  mutate(avg_speed = mean(Wind.kt)) %>% 
  distinct(Nature, avg_speed) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Nature, y = avg_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous("Average Speed (knot)")
```

## Model Performance

We evaluate the performance of predictive ability by calculating the RMSE and the $R^2$ values for each hurricane. The residuals of Bayesian estimates that converged after iterations from MCMC will be used to predict the wind speed of test dataset.
The overall $R^2$ is 0.822 and overall RMSE is 4.51. The valid $R^2$ is filtered with values between 0 and 1 and we get 77.5% hurriacanes (540) indicating that 22.5% of the estimated Bayesian models do not track hurricanes well and have negative $R^2$. One of the reason may be the limited number of observations of the hurricanes.
Figure 7 shows the 10 hurriances with the least 10 RMSE. $R^2$ are also large enough to indicates that the estimated model track most hurricanes well and the smallest RMSE is GUSTAV.1996 with $R^2$ being 0.952.

dt_rmse %>% head(10) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Figure 8 shows the actual wind speed and the estimated wind speed of randomly selected four hurricanes . We can see that most parts of the two curves overlapped indicating that the predicted values are close to the actual values. In DEBBY.2006, we can see that this is a very good model prediction with small deviation.

## Predict the hurricane-induced damage and deaths
Firstly, we plot deaths and financial loss separately. Figure 99. shows the distributions of deaths and damage. We could easily find that a few points which are far away from most of points indicate serious damage of society. In predictions of disasters, these extreme points are important because they enables the model the ability to predict the worst outcome. Therefore, we keep these points in model building.
\begin{center}
Figure 99. Distributions of Damage and Deaths
\end{center}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("beta.res.postmean.Rdata")
dat = read.csv("hurricanoutcome2.csv") %>% 
  rename(id = HurricanID)

dat$Deaths = gsub(",","",dat$Deaths)
dat$Damage = gsub("\\$", "", dat$Damage)
dat_q6 = dat %>% 
  mutate(Damage = as.numeric(Damage),
         Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths),
         Season = as.numeric(Season),
         Maxspeed = as.numeric(Maxspeed),
         Month = as.factor(Month),
         Nature = as.factor(Nature))

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(dat_q6$Damage, xlab = "Hurricanes", ylab = "Damage")
plot(dat_q6$Deaths, xlab = "Hurricanes", ylab = "Deaths")
```

In order to build a model that combines information in original data and the estimated coefficients from the Bayesian model, we extract the coefficients from the previous results. By taking the average of $\beta_{i}$ at different time points, we obtain $\beta_{0}  \sim  \beta_{4}$ of each hurricane. Part of the results is shown in Table 99.

\begin{center}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
load("beta.res.postmean.Rdata")
dat = read.csv("hurricanoutcome2.csv") %>% 
  rename(id = HurricanID)

dat$Deaths = gsub(",","",dat$Deaths)
dat$Damage = gsub("\\$", "", dat$Damage)
dat_q6 = dat %>% 
  mutate(Damage = as.numeric(Damage),
         Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths),
         Season = as.numeric(Season),
         Maxspeed = as.numeric(Maxspeed),
         Month = as.factor(Month),
         Nature = as.factor(Nature))
dat_hur = read.csv("hurrican703.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(id = tolower(id),wind_early = lag(wind_kt, 1)) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

dat_before = beta.res.postmean %>% 
  rename(id = ID) %>% 
  mutate(id = tolower(id))

combine_data = merge(dat_before, dat_hur, by = "id") %>% 
  rename(beta1 = Wind_prev, beta2 = Lat_change, beta3 = Long_change, beta4 = Wind_change) %>% 
  select(id, season, month, nature, intercept, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4)

combine.data2 = combine_data %>% 
  select(id, intercept, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4) %>% 
  group_by(id, intercept, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4) %>% 
  summarize(nobs = n())

data_res = merge(combine.data2, dat_q6, by = "id")
data_res = data_res %>% 
  mutate(nobs = as.numeric(nobs),
         Maxpressure = as.numeric(Maxpressure),
         Hours = as.numeric(Hours),
         Total.Pop = as.numeric(Total.Pop))

Coef_table = data_res %>% 
  select(id, intercept, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

Fortunately, 43 hurricanes recorded in $hurricanoutcome2.csv$ are also in $hurrican703.csv$. Thus, we merge two data frame by hurricane id to predict the deaths and damage caused by hurricanes.

The death variable is a count variable, so we decided to use Poisson regression to analysis relationship between death and other variables excluding damage. We use `Total.Pop` and `Hours` as the offset, since the outcome of deaths is proportional and the results would be different in some dimension (different populations, different duration). The Poisson regression is:

\begin{center}
$log(E(Deaths)) = \beta_{i}X_{i} + offset$
\end{center}

Where $X_{i}$ indicates all predictors included in the model. We use `glm` function to achieve the Poisson model. The coefficients result is in Table 99.
\begin{center}
Table 99. Coefficients of Deaths Prediction
\end{center}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_deaths = data_res %>% 
  select(-c(id, Damage))
offset_pop = data_deaths %>% pull(Total.Pop)
offset_dur = data_deaths %>% pull(Hours)
deaths.fit = glm(Deaths ~ . + offset(log(offset_pop)) + offset(log(offset_dur)), data = data_deaths %>% select(-c(Total.Pop, Hours)), family = "poisson")
deaths.tidy = summary(deaths.fit) %>% na.omit()
knitr::kable(deaths.tidy$coefficients)
```

From the results, $\beta_{0}  \sim  \beta_{4}$ indicate the relatively strong association. Especially, $\beta_{1}$, which represents the earlier wind speed has the biggest coefficient. We could conclude that high wind speed of hurricane more easily leads to serious casualties. Also, months seem to be an important factor in prediction. Comparing to June and September, July, November and October have lower proportion of death given all other variables constant. 

In order to obtain the integer data, we transform the units of `Damage` from billion to million. Thus, `Damage` could be regarded as a count variable which could also be fitted by Poisson regression. In order to adjust the exposure, we use `Hours` as the offset.

\begin{center}
$log(E(Damage*1000)) = \beta_{i}X_{i} + offset$
\end{center}

Where $X_{i}$ presents all predictors included in the model. We use `glm` function to achieve the Poisson model. The coefficients results is in Table 99.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
df_total = data.frame()
coef_res = function(table){
  for (i in 1:22) {
    df = table[i,]
    if(table[i,5]<0.05){df_total = rbind(df_total, df) 
    i = i + 1}
    else{i = i +1}
  }
  print(df_total)
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_damage = data_res %>% 
  select(-c(id, Deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(Damage = 1000*Damage)

offset_dur_damage = data_deaths %>% pull(Hours)
require(broom)
damage.fit = glm(Damage ~.+ offset(log(offset_dur_damage)), data = data_damage %>% select(-Hours), family = "poisson"(link = "log"))
damage.tidy = tidy(damage.fit)



table6 = knitr::kable(damage.tidy)
table6
```

The results of coefficients in predicting damage also show the importance of $\beta_{1}$. From the model, we can see that serious casualties are also accompanied by serious financial losses which are strongly influenced by earlier wind speed and are slightly affected by months, latitude change, longitude change and wind speed change. $\beta_{0}  \sim  \beta_{4}$ are generally powerful in damage and deaths prediction.
